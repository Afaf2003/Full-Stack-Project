# Full Stack Website

This repository serves as a demonstration of a dynamic website, showcasing its functionality and components.

## What is a Dynamic Website?

A dynamic website is a type of website that generates content dynamically in response to user interactions or input. Unlike static websites, where the content remains fixed and unchanged, dynamic websites can alter their content based on various factors such as user preferences, database information, or real-time data.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the website by submitting forms, clicking buttons, or navigating through different pages.
- **Data Retrieval and Manipulation**: The website fetches data from a database or external sources and displays it dynamically.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Certain parts of the website may update dynamically without requiring a page refresh, such as chat applications or live data feeds.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB 
- **Other Tools**: VS Code
